# Getting Started

This page helps navigate the interface of the **Scenario Tool**, providing information for each step of the way, on top of the existing information present on the platform. 

## 1. Define Your Objective

</figure>


A one-size-fits-all approach to budget allocation simply doesn't work. Your marketing objectives change, and your measurement tools should be flexible enough to change with them. The **Scenario Tool** offers three core objectives to support any business goal:

* **A Set Budget:** Ideal for initial planning, this mode allows you to input a fixed budget and see the predicted return. It's the perfect way to draft an initial **media budget allocation** and forecast the level of returns your investment will deliver.  
* **A Target Uplift:** When your focus is on aggressive growth, this option is your go-to. Instead of starting with a budget, you set a target for new customers or revenue. The tool then calculates the optimal spend and channel mix to hit or exceed your growth targets. This is crucial for answering questions like, "What extra customers can my marketing drive?"  
* **Unconstrained:** This feature is for brands focused on sustainable, profitable growth. Without setting a specific budget or a target uplift, the optimisation will provide a recommended budget that will generate the highest **net uplift**\*. It helps you identify exactly how much more you can spend while staying profitable.

**net uplift = uplift - spend*

## 2. Set the Time Period:

The simplest element to understand\! Our tool allows you to run scenarios for different time horizons, be it the next month, quarter, six months, or year. 

This flexibility is critical for both short-term tactical adjustments and longer-term annual planning.

## 3. What-If Factors:

This is where the Linea Analytics platform offers flexibility. Our tool goes far beyond simple budget sliders, giving you granular control over the variables that matter most to your business.

#### **Channels and Campaigns to Include:**

</figure>

You have the flexibility to select which channels or even specific campaigns to include or exclude from a scenario. This is vital for **Long-Term vs. Short-Term Goals**. You can focus your allocation on brand-building channels that drive long-term impact or on performance channels for immediate results. Or select all and let past performance decide.

#### **Impact of Future Changes for specific channels.**

</figure>


Use the multiplier to impact:

* Overlay how cost inflation might impact channel allocation  
* How creative changes could increase performance	

Setting the multiplier values:

* The multiplier is pre-set at 1\.   
* A multiplier of **1.1**: Reflects a 10% **increase** in the impact of that channel, e.g. a 10% increase in creative efficiency   
* A multiplier of **0.9**: Reflects a 10% **reduction** in the impact of that channel, e.g. a 10% cost inflation

#### **Impact of Future Changes:** 

<figure  class="p-5">
  <img src="./guides/img/inputs-synergy.png" width="100%" class="rounded" alt="screenshot setting the synergy variable to include in the optimisation">
</figure>


Predicting the future is impossible, but with our scenario tool, you can prepare for it.

* Use the synergy to capture changes to the market, economy or how a product change might impact your marketing effort.  
* The synergy is set to be the same as the measured year. A 10% increase in this reflects a performance improvement. 

We recommend running multiple scenarios with different assumptions, you can build a comprehensive understanding of potential outcomes, mitigating risk and presenting a range of options to wider teams.

## 4. Inspect Results and Compare Scenarios

After the inputs have been provided, the scenario will be ready to run. Whether you've set a target budget or a desired acquisition number, the **Scenario Tool** instantly provides an optimised media mix recommendation.

You can now save your scenarios and compare the impact of how different conditions impact your plans:

1. Changes in revenue, or new customers, that can be generated with your marketing  
2. Optimal channel/campaign budget allocation  
3. Budget laydown: Spend recommendations for each week in your media plan
